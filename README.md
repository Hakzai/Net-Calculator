# Net-Calculator

This is a simple calculator that works through network, where the idea was just to understand the concept of streams in Java.

There isn't a manual here, but you need to choose the operation and then put the two numbers for the chosen operation.

The project uploaded was created in Eclipse in JAVA 8.
